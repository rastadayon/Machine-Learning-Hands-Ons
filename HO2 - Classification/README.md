# MNIST Classification
In this hands-on project we aimed at distinguishing between the handwritten number of 4 and other numbers in the MNIST dataset using various classification methods, thus making it a binary classification task.

The methods used are listed bellow:
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Nearest Centroid Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression Classifier**

For each of the methods the following metrics are computed and reported:
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Accuracy**
- **Sensitivity**
- **Specificity**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**

Also **ROC curve** of each classifier is plotted and the **AUC** is reported
